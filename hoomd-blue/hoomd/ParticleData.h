//! Manages all of the data arrays for the particles
/*! <h1> General </h1>
    ParticleData stores and manages particle coordinates, velocities, accelerations, type,
    and tag information. This data must be available both via the CPU and GPU memories.
    All copying of data back and forth from the GPU is accomplished transparently by GlobalArray.

    For performance reasons, data is stored as simple arrays. Once a handle to the particle data
    GlobalArrays has been acquired, the coordinates of the particle with
    <em>index</em> \c i can be accessed with <code>pos_array_handle.data[i].x</code>,
    <code>pos_array_handle.data[i].y</code>, and <code>pos_array_handle.data[i].z</code>
    where \c i runs from 0 to <code>getN()</code>.

    Velocities and other properties can be accessed in a similar manner.

    \note Position and type are combined into a single Scalar4 quantity. x,y,z specifies the
   position and w specifies the type. Use __scalar_as_int() / __int_as_scalar() (or __int_as_float()
   / __float_as_int()) to extract / set this integer that is masquerading as a scalar.

    \note Velocity and mass are combined into a single Scalar4 quantity. x,y,z specifies the
   velocity and w specifies the mass.

    \warning Local particles can and will be rearranged in the arrays throughout a simulation.
    So, a particle that was once at index 5 may be at index 123 the next time the data
    is acquired. Individual particles can be tracked through all these changes by their (global)
   tag. The tag of a particle is stored in the \c m_tag array, and the ith element contains the tag
   of the particle with index i. Conversely, the the index of a particle with tag \c tag can be read
   from the element at position \c tag in the a \c m_rtag array.

    In a parallel simulation, the global tag is unique among all processors.

    In order to help other classes deal with particles changing indices, any class that
    changes the order must call notifyParticleSort(). Any class interested in being notified
    can subscribe to the signal by calling connectParticleSort().

    Some fields in ParticleData are not computed and assigned by default because they require
   additional processing time. PDataFlags is a bitset that lists which flags (enumerated in
   pdata_flag) are enable/disabled. Computes should call getFlags() and compute the requested
   quantities whenever the corresponding flag is set. Updaters and Analyzers can request flags be
   computed via their getRequestedPDataFlags() methods. A particular updater or analyzer should
    return a bitset PDataFlags with only the bits set for the flags that it needs. During a run,
   System will query the updaters and analyzers that are to be executed on the current step. All of
   the flag requests are combined with the binary or operation into a single set of flag requests.
   System::run() then sets the flags by calling setPDataFlags so that the computes produce the
   requested values during that step.

    These fields are:
     - pdata_flag::pressure_tensor - specify that the full virial tensor is valid
     - pdata_flag::external_field_virial - specify that an external virial contribution is valid

    If these flags are not set, these arrays can still be read but their values may be incorrect.

    If any computation is unable to supply the appropriate values (i.e. rigid body virial can not be
   computed until the second step of the simulation), then it should remove the flag to signify that
   the values are not valid. Any analyzer/updater that expects the value to be set should check the
   flags that are actually set.

    \note Particles are not checked if their position is actually inside the local box. In fact,
   when using spatial domain decomposition, particles may temporarily move outside the boundaries.

    \ingroup data_structs

    ## Parallel simulations

    In a parallel simulation, the ParticleData contains he local particles only, and getN() returns
   the current number of \a local particles. The method getNGlobal() can be used to query the \a
   global number of particles on all processors.

    During the simulation particles may enter or leave the box, therefore the number of \a local
   particles may change. To account for this, the size of the particle data arrays is dynamically
   updated using amortized doubling of the array sizes. To add particles to the domain, the
   addParticles() method is called, and the arrays are resized if necessary. Particles are retrieved
    and removed from the local particle data arrays using removeParticles(). To flag particles for
   removal, set the communication flag (m_comm_flags) for that particle to a non-zero value.

    In addition, since many other classes maintain internal arrays holding data for every particle
   (such as neighbor lists etc.), these arrays need to be resized, too, if the particle number
   changes. Every time the particle data arrays are reallocated, a maximum particle number change
   signal is triggered. Other classes can subscribe to this signal using
   connectMaxParticleNumberChange(). They may use the current maximum size of the particle arrays,
   which is returned by getMaxN().  This size changes only infrequently (by amortized array
   resizing). Note that getMaxN() can return a higher number than the actual number of particles.

    Particle data also stores temporary particles ('ghost atoms'). These are added after the local
   particle data (i.e. with indices starting at getN()). It keeps track of those particles using the
   addGhostParticles() and removeAllGhostParticles() methods. The caller is responsible for updating
   the particle data arrays with the ghost particle information.

    ## Anisotropic particles

    Anisotropic particles are handled by storing an orientation quaternion for every particle in the
   simulation. Similarly, a net torque is computed and stored for each particle. The design decision
   made is to not duplicate efforts already made to enable composite bodies of anisotropic
   particles. So the particle orientation is a read only quantity when used by most of HOOMD. To
   integrate this degree of freedom forward, the particle must be part of a composite body (there
   can be single-particle bodies, of course) where integration methods like NVERigid will handle
   updating the degrees of freedom of the composite body and then set the constrained position,
   velocity, and orientation of the constituent particles.

    Particles that are part of a floppy body will have the same value of the body flag, but that
   value must be a negative number less than -1 (which is reserved as NO_BODY). Such particles do
   not need to be treated specially by the integrator; they are integrated independently of one
   another, but they do not interact. This lack of interaction is enforced through the neighbor
    list, in which particles that belong to the same body are excluded by default.

    To enable correct initialization of the composite body moment of inertia, each particle is also
   assigned an individual moment of inertia which is summed up correctly to determine the composite
   body's total moment of inertia.

    Access the orientation quaternion of each particle with the GlobalArray gotten from
   getOrientationArray(), the net torque with getTorqueArray(). Individual inertia tensor values can
   be accessed with getMomentsOfInertia() and setMomentsOfInertia()

    The current maximum diameter of all composite particles is stored in ParticleData and can be
   requested by the NeighborList or other classes to compute rigid body interactions correctly. The
   maximum value is updated by querying all classes that compute rigid body forces for updated
   values whenever needed.

    ## Origin shifting

    Parallel MC simulations randomly translate all particles by a fixed vector at periodic
   intervals. This motion is not physical, it is merely the easiest way to shift the origin of the
   cell list / domain decomposition boundaries. Analysis routines (i.e. MSD) and movies are
   complicated by the random motion of all particles.

    ParticleData can track this origin and subtract it from all particles. This subtraction is done
   when taking a snapshot. Putting the subtraction there naturally puts the correction there for all
   analysis routines and file I/O while leaving the shifted particles in place for computes,
   updaters, and integrators. On the restoration from a snapshot, the origin needs to be cleared.

    Two routines support this: translateOrigin() and resetOrigin(). The position of the origin is
   tracked by ParticleData internally. translateOrigin() moves it by a given vector. resetOrigin()
   zeroes it. TODO: This might not be sufficient for simulations where the box size changes. We'll
   see in testing.

    ## Acceleration data

    Most initialization routines do not provide acceleration data. In this case, the integrator
   needs to compute appropriate acceleration data before time step 0 for integration to be correct.

    However, the acceleration data is valid on taking/restoring a snapshot or executing additional
   run() commands and there is no need for the integrator to provide acceleration. Doing so produces
   incorrect results with some integrators (see issue #252). Future updates to gsd may enable
   restarting with acceleration data from a file.

    The solution is to store a flag in the particle data (and in the snapshot) indicating if the
   acceleration data is valid. When it is not valid, the integrator will compute accelerations and
   make it valid in prepRun(). When it is valid, the integrator will do nothing. On initialization
   from a snapshot, ParticleData will inherit its valid flag.
