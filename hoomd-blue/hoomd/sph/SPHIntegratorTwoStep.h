/** See SPHIntegrationMethodTwoStep for most of the design notes regarding group integration.
   SPHIntegratorTwoStep merely implements most of the things discussed there.

    Notable design elements:
    - setDeltaT results in deltaT being set on all current integration methods
    - to interface with the python script, the m_methods vectors is exposed with a list like API.

   TODO: ensure that the user does not make a mistake and specify more than one method operating on
   a single particle

    There is a special registration mechanism for ForceComposites which run after the integration
   steps one and two, and which can use the updated particle positions and velocities to update any
   slaved degrees of freedom (rigid bodies).
